I started out attempting to make this program in a single file. I was well on my way, but decided to watch the video by the instructor Dennis Mohle.
This gave me a new perspective on how to approach the entire project. I was able to create a constructor for the "animal" as a separate file. I then
created a file for each individual aniamal type. I then created a "main" file that uses each individual file to build the "zoo inventory". This made
it easy to read in information from the two files and build the required data for each animal.
I learned a lot about classes and functions by completeing this exercise.
